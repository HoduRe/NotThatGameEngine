# NotThatGameEngine
An engine for CITM's Engine project which focuses on skeletical animation

## Creators:
<li>[Me (Hodu): ](https://github.com/ferba93)</li>
<li>Lots of [hopes and dreams](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91Hv6KacesL.jpg)</li>

## Instructions:
- Camera controls:<br/>
	<ul>
	<li>Right click + WASD & QE to move camera</li>
	<li>F to center an object</li>
	<li>Alt + Left click to rotate around object</li>
	<li>Mouse wheel to zoom (when scene is focused)</li>
	<li>Holding shift duplicates movement speed</li>
	</ul>
- All menus can be re-opened via Upper Menu tabs<br/>
- Drag a model on the application to load it on screen<br/>
- Drag a texture on the application to load it. If there is an object selected, it will apply that texture to the model<br/>

## Additional functionality:
- Windows have docking options enabled<br/>
- Textures are not loaded more than once<br/>
- Transforms input don't take other values but numbers and operators<br/>
- Transform input alters object transforms (word of warning: input of +90 on Y rotation makes object go party hard)<br/>
- Trees can be moved through with keyboard input (but focus is only on click)<br/>

## Additional comments:
- For user use: "Assets/", for program use: "Library/" <br/>
- Do not move the .exe of the Engine from outside its local folder <br/>
- Do not move Checkers, Alex or Degenerate textures. They are internally loaded for the user to have by default, thus the path is hardcoded :) <br/>
- Primitives do not have normals nor texture coordinates, thus they can't recieve a texture <br/>
- Give the dragon time to load :')<br/>
- Thanks to [Ricard Pillosu](https://github.com/d0n3val/Edu-Game-Engine) and [Marc Garrigó](https://github.com/markitus18/Thor-Engine) for their code samples, which helped guide myself <br/>
