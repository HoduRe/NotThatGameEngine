## Additional comments:
- Event system: <br/>
- Obligued path: the directory must be a folder named "Assets/" <br/>
- Obligued path for textures: the directory must be "Assets/Library/Textures/" <br/>
- Do not move Checkers, Alex or Degenerate textures. They are internally loaded for the user to have by default, thus the path is hardcoded :) <br/>
