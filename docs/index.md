## What is NotThatGameEngine?

NotThatGameEngine is my personal attempt to create a skeletal animation system that is functional is the context of a pseudo-engine. Its reason to be is found in the Enginge subject from CITM's third year of the Videogame Design & Development degree, conducted by our lovely teacher [Marc Garrig√≥](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mgarrigo/). His engine has been used as reference: [ThorEngine](https://github.com/markitus18/Thor-Engine).

### Team members

Me: I did everything. Well, props to hopes & dreams for being there as well, and Thor Engine, because let's face it, having reference makes things easier. A photo of me:
