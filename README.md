# NotThatGameEngine
An engine for CITM's Engine project which focuses on skeletical animation

## Creators:
- [Me (Hodu)](https://github.com/ferba93)<br/>
- Lots of [hopes and dreams](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91Hv6KacesL.jpg)<br/>

## Instructions:
- Camera controls:<br/>
	<ul>
	<li>Right click + WASD & QE to move camera</li>
	<li>F to center an object</li>
	<li>Alt + Left click to rotate around object</li>
	<li>Mouse wheel to zoom (when scene is focused)</li>
	<li>Holding shift duplicates movement speed</li>
	</ul>
- All menus can be re-opened via Upper Menu tabs<br/>
- Drag a model on the application to load it on screen<br/>
- Drag a texture on the application to load it. If there is an object selected, it will apply that texture to the model<br/>
- Create GO creates a game object, child to whatever is focused<br/>
- Delete GO deletes the focused game object and its childs<br/>
- Game objects that have focus can be deleted with Supr / Delete key<br/>

## Additional functionality:
- Windows have docking options enabled<br/>
- Transforms input don't take other values but numbers and operators<br/>
- Trees can be moved through with keyboard input (but focus is only on click)<br/>

## Additional comments:
- For user use: "Assets/", the program uses: "Library/" <br/>
- Do not move the .exe of the Engine from outside its local folder <br/>
- You can move "Alex", "Checker" and "Degenerate" textures as much as you want around Assets/, but don't change their name...<br/>
- You can't have files with duplicated names, or it will only read. Capital and lowercase letters are considered different<br/>
- Primitives do not have normals nor texture coordinates, thus they can't recieve a texture <br/>
